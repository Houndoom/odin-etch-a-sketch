# Odin Foundations: Etch-a-sketch

Mouseover the board to colour the squares with random colours! The colours on a square darken with successive passes until it turns completely black.

The board starts at a granularity of 16 squares in each axis. You may change the granularity by clicking on the "Change number of squares" button.
